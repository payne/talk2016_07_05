# D3 charts in Ember

1. I’ll present [Sophie DeBenedetto](https://twitter.com/sm_debenedetto)’s blog post [“Using Ember Charts to Integrate D3.js into your Ember App”](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/using-ember-charts-to-integrate-d3-with-ember/) for five to six minutes. She created [Who-ipedia](https://whoipedia.herokuapp.com/): an [ember front end](https://github.com/SophieDeBenedetto/whoipedia-front) with [rails serving an api](https://github.com/sophiedebenedetto/whoipedia-api). I’ll present her work and my brief experience with it. This talk will set you up to start enjoying Sophie’s wonderful work.
1. Sophie writes:
   1. "Who-ipedia is an encyclopedia of Doctor Who episodes, cataloguing episodes by season and offering episode synopses and info on episode writers."
   1. "The app also incorporates D3 to visualize the popularity of recurring aliens by season, (the Daleks are the most prevalent, in case you were wondering)."

# Quickstart

1. Read Sophie's blog, for an overview.  Read it again later.  [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) FTW
1. `git clone front end`
   1. `cd front-end`
   1. `npm install`
   1. `bower install`
   1. `ember serve`
   1. http://LocalHost:4200 -- note it is using Sophie's heroku server :-(


---

# Get your own server!  -- Prerequisites

1. Launch http://postgresapp.com
1. Install ruby on rails....
   1. `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

---

# Clone and run the server

1. `git clone back-end`
1. `cd back-end`
1. `bundle`
1. `bin/rake db:setup`
    1. Behold all the data it scrapes!
1. `bin/rails s`

---

# Connect to server on localhost

1. Edit front-end as described in the README.md to point at your backend on localhost.   Don't forget to change the https to http.
1. ember serve
1. `rails c` or `psql` etc to change the data....

---

# Walk through Sophie's blog
1. `D3 can be used via the xyzzy component`
1. "Now that the Ember Charts library is installed, we have access to the {{bubble-chart}} component, which we can render like this:"
1.
```HTML5
<div class="chart-container">
  {{bubble-chart data=bubbleData}}
</div>
```

---

# Data
1. "The bubble chart component expects a data collection that is structured like this:"
   1.
   ```javascript
   [
    {:label=>"some item", :value=> <some amount>},
    {:label=>"some item", :value=> <some amount>},
    {:label=>"some item", :value=> <some amount>}
   ]
   ```
1. The rails api returns the data in that shape
